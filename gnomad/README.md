Please make sure that, the interested genes are available through the web call at https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/.

After you have listed interested genes, run the script as follows;

`python3 gnomad_merger.py`

While script is running, downloaded CSV gene data is saved in `./data` folder. You can browse them individually if you are interested in seperate genes.

When the script finished running, the final merged CSV output is saved in `./output/genes_merged.csv` file. Please make sure to copy and save this file before running the script agaian with different gene input list.
